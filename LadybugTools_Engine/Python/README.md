# LadybugTools_Toolkit

The code contained here is intended to be used in conjunction with the LadybugTools_Toolkit, as part of a wider [BHoM](https://bhom.xyz/) installation. Its main purpose is to provide shortcuts to shorten workflows using code provided by [Ladybug Tools](https://github.com/ladybug-tools).

## Installation

For this toolkit to work successfully, [Pollination](https://www.pollination.cloud/) should be installed first, after which the method `BH.Engine.LadybugTools.Compute.InstallPythonEnv_LBT` should be run. This will create a mirror-image of the Pollination Python environment within the BHoM installation directory (`C:\ProgramData\BHoM\Extensions\PythonEnvironments\LadybugTools_Toolkit`) from which the code here can be accessed.
