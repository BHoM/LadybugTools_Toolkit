The functionality stored within these methods is dependent on several methods \
and workflows outlined in \
https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/ABC_toolbox/tree/main.

The methods are used to interact with the ABC model API, which is a \
web-based tool that simulates the thermal condition of a person in an \
environment, subject to environmental paramaters and their physical condition.
